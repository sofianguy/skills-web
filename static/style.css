/*Create a CSS file, styles.css, that stylizes application-form.html.

Make sure to try some of the following:

Changing the background color of all of the form input boxes and submit button
to be yellow (can you do this for all input boxes without having to stylize each 
one independently?)

Changes the text in the last name field to be bolded 
(hint: thatâ€™s the font-weight property).

Draws a border around the instruction box.

Have your HTML file use styles.css.
